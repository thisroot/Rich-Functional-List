# RICH FUNCTIONAL LIST
#### v1.0.0

RFL is a jQuery cards plugin built with good UX in mind. It's responsive, touch-compatible, and integrates well with other jQuery plugins. Everything you could want to build modern card apps.

## Bugs & things that need to be done:
  - Logic for dragging cards to empty main list.
    - Have a little white part open when main trigger is clicked (indicating you can move something there).
    - Make sure main list always has trigger icon.
  - Text boxes resize responsively when window resizes.
  - Get just the icons used from font-awesome, download them, & remove that dependency.
  - Update readme file with install instructions, documentation, etc.
